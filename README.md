# Tumor Tissue Identification
Here, we develop an integrative convolutional-neural-network (CNN)-based identification module to recognize cancerous tissue in whole-slide images of cancerous tissue from patient biopsies. Here, we train our model on a previously established dataset of histopathology images labeled with cancer/not-cancer tissue annotations.
