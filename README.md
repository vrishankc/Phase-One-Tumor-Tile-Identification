# Tumor Tissue Identification
Here, we develop an integrative convolutional-neural-network (CNN)-based identification module to recognize cancerous tissue in whole-slide images from patient biopsies. Here, we train our model on a previously established dataset of histopathology images labeled with cancer/benign tissue annotations. This module is to be used as a preprocessing tool when attempting to identify prognostically-relevant tissue regions.
